# Pre-work - CodePath-TodoTask

CodePath-TodoTask2 is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Kavya Ravi Shankar

Time spent: 5+4+4 hours spent in total so far.

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
* User can tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented (so far):

* Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* Priority of tasks.

Other features:
* Setting up due dates for the task.
* Adding a note to the task.
